# UNLO Code

[UN/LOCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN/LOCODE) assign codes to locations in the world. 

For this app the list is limited to (sea) ports only. Codes have five characters. The first two are country code and the last three are  code for the port.

As example NLRTM
- NL -> Netherlands
- RTM -> Rotterdam.

This is my go to project whenever I will tinker with a new language.

This version is a simple cli app written in nodejs (requires [node to be installed](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs))

```fish
git clone git@github.com:medevdk/node-unlocode.git

cd node-unlocode
```

#### Usage ####
```fish
node index.js
```

The menu speaks for itself. To quit just enter 'q' or 'exit' at the menu prompt.
