# UNLO Code

[UN/LOCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN/LOCODE) assign codes to locations in the world. For this app the list is limited to (sea) ports only. Codes have five characters. The first two are country code and the last 3 are port code.
As example NLRTM - Netherlands Rotterdam.

This is my go to project whenever I will tinker with a new language.

This version is a simple cli app written in nodejs.

```fish
git clone https://github.com/medevdk/node-unlocode.git

cd node-unlocode
```

## Usage
```fish
node index.js
```

The menu speaks for itself. To quit just enter 'q' or 'exit' at the menu prompt.
